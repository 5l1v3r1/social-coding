title: Social Coding with the Berlin Underground
---

Welcome to the Berlin Underground! We are a secret organisation
planning world domination. This involves a lot of planning, which
means we need to know all the best cafes, bars and restaurants in
Berlin. After all, nobody wants to take over the world on an empty
stomach.

The Berlin Underground is organised like this:

* The Grand Poobah: Steven Farlie. Leader of the Berlin Underground,
  devourer of falafel. The Grand Poobah only talks to his trusted
  Coaches.
* The Coaches. Learned in the ways of Social Coding. They encourage
  the efforts of the students, and can communicate directly with the
  Grand Poobah.
* The Students. New initiates to the Underground. Yet to fully behold
  the wonders of social coding.

# Crisis!

The Berlin Underground is in crisis! The most honourable Grand Poobah
has declared that we do not have enough cafes, bars or restaurants in
our repository. Our planning efforts depend heavily on having enough
food, caffeine and alcohol. Without places to hang out the
organisation will wither away, as students, coaches and even the Grand
Poobah himself spend more and more of their time at home, browsing cat
pictures on the internet.

Your mission is to add to our database of Berlin bars, restaurants and
cafes. The goal is to get your changes into the master repository
[stevenfarlie/berlin-underground](https://github.com/stevenfarlie/berlin-underground). However,
the Grand Poobah, Steven Farlie, does not accept changes from just
anybody. The Grand Poobah will only accept pull requests from one of
his trusted lieutenants, the Coaches.
