In the programming community there are a few useful ways to find out
about new software. Blogs and news sites like
[Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com),
[Reddit](http://reddit.com/r/programming) and
[Slashdot](http://slashdot.org) are good for learning new tools and
techniques, but it is fairly random that you would learn something
relevant.

[GitHub Expore](https://github.com/explore) provides a neat overview
of active repositories at GitHub. You can find top trending
repositories like [kittydar](https://github.com/harthur/kittydar)
(face detection for cats). You can even
[filter by languages](https://github.com/languages) such as
[Javascript](https://github.com/languages/JavaScript),
[Python](https://github.com/languages/Python) or even
[Prolog](https://github.com/languages/Prolog) if you are into
something a little more esoteric.

GitHub Explore is also where you'll find the more complete
[GitHub Search](https://github.com/search), for when you want to find
something very specific.

When you find something you like, be sure to star it. That makes it a
lot easier to find it later, and also gives the repository a little
more visibility. More stars means more eyeballs, which means
potentially a post on Hacker News or Reddit, which means more stars,
and so on. It's a vicious cycle!
