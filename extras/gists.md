title: GitHub Gist

One common problem in programming is showing code examples to
others. It's unfortunate, but some days you spend more time trying to
understand errors than writing new code. Those days you spend a lot of
time searching forums or
[Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com). But many of these forums
don't support code formatting with nice syntax highlighting, and it is
difficult for others to contribute fixes.

This is where paste websites such as [Pastebin](http://pastebin.com/),
[Pastie](http://pastie.org/) and [Codepad](http://codepad.org/) become
useful, allowing you to paste and share code with others. GitHub has a
similar system, called [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/).

Basic usages is simple. Just paste your code and select one of the
billion or so languages from the _Language_ list. Your code will show up
formatted and you can share the URL with anybody and
everybody. GitHubbers can add their own comments, or fork your gist
into gists of their own.

## Shiny text gists

Using Markdown in your gist will end up with it being rendered into
HTML when viewed on the GitHub website. So if you have some important
piece of text feel free to add some format to it.

## Gist is just Git!

A gist is a Git repository. So it can be cloned, pulled and pushed
just like any other Git repository. You can use this to "upgrade" your
gist repository into a full GitHub repository.

## More gist magic

There are a few third-party services that have started around gists:

* [bl.ocks.org](http://bl.ocks.org/) - Can turn gists into full
webpages. For example: [Epicyclic Gearing](http://bl.ocks.org/1353700) or [Molecule](http://bl.ocks.org/3037015).
* [gist.io](http://gist.io/) - Can turn a gist into a blog post. ([example](http://gist.io/3135754))
* [gistflow](http://gistflow.com) - Is like a social network of gists.
